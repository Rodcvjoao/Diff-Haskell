# Diff Haskell
This project intends to be similar (given its proportions) to the Github algorithm that shows changed, added and removed lines when editing code.

This repository has, besides the haskell files, a bunch of .txt (including previous versions of the code itself) where the user can use them to compare the changes and see the algorithm running.

## Running the code

1. First step is to git clone the repository to your local computer (URL: https://github.com/Rodcvjoao/Diff-Haskell.git)
2. Second is to compile the code with: **ghc main.hs** (If you run into troubles, try adding functions.hs to the compiling line)
3. Lastly, run ./main *filename1* *filename2*
