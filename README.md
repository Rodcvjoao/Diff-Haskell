#Diff Haskell

In this Haskell project, the task given was to create a program that works similar to a Hamming Distance algorithm. 

The diferences resides in the fact that the compared strings would come from two different files, and the output written on a third file should be, in fact, the average of the previous iterations added to the current hamming distance between the strings.
